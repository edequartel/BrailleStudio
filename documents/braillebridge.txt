braillebridge API documentation

Host (HTTP API)

Base address
http://localhost:5000

This is a local HTTP server running on the user’s machine. It is used to send commands to the braille display.

Send text to the braille display
Method: POST
Path: /braille
Full URL: http://localhost:5000/braille

Request body (JSON):
{
“text”: “Hello braille”,
“pad”: true
}

The field “text” contains the text to show on the braille display.
The optional field “pad” pads the text to the display width (for example 40 cells).

Clear the braille display
Method: POST
Path: /clear
Full URL: http://localhost:5000/clear

This clears all braille cells. No request body is required.

Status / health check (if enabled)
Method: GET
Path: /status
Full URL: http://localhost:5000/status

Typical response contains whether the bridge is running, if a braille display is connected, the device name, and the number of cells.


WebSocket

WebSocket address

ws://localhost:5000/ws

This WebSocket is used to send braille key events from BrailleBridge to the client (browser or app). The client connects once and receives events as they occur.

Message format (JSON)

All messages are JSON objects and include a “kind” field that indicates the event type.

Thumb key event example:
{
“kind”: “Thumbkey”,
“name”: “LeftThumb”,
“press”: true
}

Possible thumb key names:
LeftThumb
MiddleLeftThumb
MiddleRightThumb
RightThumb

The field “press” is true when the key is pressed and false when released.

Cursor routing event example:
{
“kind”: “CursorRouting”,
“index”: 12,
“press”: true
}

The field “index” is the braille cell index (0-based).

Raw / diagnostic event example:
{
“kind”: “Raw”,
“msgType”: 8,
“unit”: 1,
“strip”: 0,
“btn”: 2097152,
“press”: true
}
