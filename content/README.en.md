## Short Guide

**BrailleStudio** is the online environment that works together with the Windows application **BrailleBridge**.  
With BrailleStudio, you can practise letters, words, stories, and exercises on your braille display.

## What you need

1. A Windows computer with BrailleBridge running.  
2. A braille display connected via USB or Bluetooth.  
3. A web browser such as Chrome, Edge, or Firefox.  
4. The BrailleStudio website opened in the browser.

## Getting started

1. Start BrailleBridge on the computer.  
2. Connect the braille display.  
3. Open BrailleServer in the browser.  
4. Choose an exercise, such as letters, words, or stories.

## Using the braille display

- The text on the screen appears on the braille display.  
- You can press letters and words using cursor routing.  
- The thumb keys are used for navigation.

## Activities

### Letters and words
You practise letters and words by listening to them and following them on the braille display.

### Stories
A story is read aloud. You can pause, continue, and go back.

### Exercises
There are activities such as:
- measuring reading speed  
- dictation  
- answering questions about a text  
- auditory feedback during practice  

## Learning Through Play

BrailleStudio follows the principle of *Learning Through Play*.  
Key characteristics of this approach are:

- children learn best by actively exploring  
- the learner has freedom of choice and control  
- making mistakes is part of learning and provides information  
- activities combine fun with challenge  
- skills grow through playful practice  

In BrailleStudio, this means that activities are short, clear, and playful, with direct feedback through braille, sound, and interaction.

## Audio

Sounds are loaded automatically.  
If audio does not work, check whether:
- the volume is turned on  
- the browser is allowed to play audio  
- the page has fully loaded  

## Common problems

### No connection to the braille display
